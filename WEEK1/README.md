# Climate Risk Analysis Project WEEK 1

## Overview

currently this project analyzes historical climate data to identify trends, anomalies, and risks associated with climate change. The goal is to better understand temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather patterns, and to assess how these changes might impact ecosystems, agriculture, and human livelihoods.

By using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn), the project performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of climate patterns.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze historical weather data (temperature, precipitation, etc.).
* Identify seasonal patterns and long-term trends.
* Detect extreme events (heatwaves or coldwaves).
* Provide visual insights (line plots, heatmaps, bar charts).
* Support climate risk assessment for decision-making.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset contains historical climate information, including:

*  Temperature (min, max, average)
*  Precipitation
*  Other factors (humidity, wind speed, WeatherCondition)

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. Data Collection -> Import dataset (`.csv`) from Kaggle.
2. Data Cleaning -> Handle missing values, outliers, and formatting.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) -> Statistical summary + visualizations.
4. Trend Analysis -> Plot long-term changes in temperature & rainfall.
5. Extreme Events Detection -> detect the anomaly and give alerts
6. Conclusion & Insights -> Document climate risks and recommendations.
