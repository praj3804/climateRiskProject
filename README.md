# AI-Powered Temperature Anomaly Detection & Early Warning System

##  Project Overview

Extreme temperature events such as **heatwaves and cold waves** are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. These anomalies pose serious risks to:

* Public health
* Agriculture
* Energy demand
* Disaster preparedness

Most existing systems depend on **IoT sensor networks** and delayed reports, making real-time local anomaly detection and awareness challenging for the general public.

This project aims to build a **lightweight AI/ML-powered system** that:

* Uses **real-time weather data** to detect and forecast **Early Warnings** about short-term temperature anomalies.
* Provides **safety guidance** through a conversational chatbot interface.
* Helps **communities and individuals take proactive measures** against heatwaves and cold waves.

##  Objectives

* Collect and analyze historical + real-time weather datasets.
* Build ML models to detect anomalies in temperature patterns and train using existing datasets.
* Forecast short-term risks of heatwaves/cold waves.
* Deploy a **chatbot interface** for safety recommendations.

---

##  Tech Stack

* **Python** – Data preprocessing & ML models
* **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Scikit-learn / TensorFlow** – ML model development
* **Flask/FastAPI** – Backend service for chatbot integration
* **Streamlit** (optional) – Interactive visualization dashboard
* **OpenWeather API** – Real-time weather data

##  How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Fetch historical + real-time weather data.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for analysis.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: ML model detects unusual temperature spikes/drops.
4. **Forecasting**: Predict short-term risks of heatwaves/cold waves.
5. **Alerts**: Provide warnings and safety measures to users.

##  Expected Outcomes

* Real-time anomaly detection for extreme temperature events.
* Forecasting models to predict short-term risks.
* Chatbot-based alerts with **safety recommendations** for individuals and communities.
* Visualizations of anomaly trends and risks.

---

##  Future Scope

* Extend to cover rainfall, floods, and drought risks.
* Integrate with mobile app for **push notifications**.
* Add **multilingual chatbot support** for wider accessibility.
